# genetic-algorithm-tsp
Genetic algorithm solution for the travelling salesman problem in Matlab

This project goal was to compare four metaheuristics : simulated annealing, genetic algorithm, ant colony optimization algorithms and tabu search.

Our team both programmed the genetic algorithm and made a study and state of the art on the simulated annealing.
